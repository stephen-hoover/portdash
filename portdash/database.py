"""Access stored data on transactions and values

Each account is stored as a pandas DataFrame.
The DataFrame is indexed by date, with one row per day, starting at
the first day shown on the dashboard and continuing to the last day
covered by the dashboard.

Each account DataFrame has the following columns:
 _total : Total dollar value of the account on that day
 _total_dist : Cumulative dollar value of all distributions up to that day
 cash : Total cash holdings in the account
 contributions : Cumulative dollar value of all contributions to the account
 withdrawals :  Cumulative dollar value of all withdrawals from the account

In addition, each account has three columns per security held in the account.
(These columns exist for each security which has been present in the account
at any point during its history.) These columns are prefixed by the
stock exchange trading symbol.
 [SYMBOL] : Total units of that security held on that day
 [SYMBOL]_value : Total dollar value of that security on that day
 [SYMBOL]_dist : Cumulative distributions from that security in the account
